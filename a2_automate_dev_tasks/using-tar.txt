1.1) The short option "-c" is used to create a file in conjunction with the option "-f [ARCHIVE NAME]" to name the created archive.
	For example, "tar -cf [ARCHIVE NAME]" creates an empty archive, to archive a file/directory, add a source to the end of the command.
1.2) The short option "-t" is used to list the contents of an archive in conjunction with the option "-f [FILENAME] to name the archive.
	For example, "tar tf [TAR FILE]" lists out the archive's contents and the "-v" (verbose) option can be added to list out more information.
1.3) The short option "-x" is used to extract the entire contents of an archive with the "-f [ARCHIVE NAME]" option.
	For example, "tar -xf [TAR FILE]" extracts the whole archive.
1.4) By default, the contents of the archive get extracted to the same directory as the archive
1.5) The significance of the extensions .tar and .gz is that tar itself is an archive file (Tape ARchive), which means its a collection of files.
	While .gz represents GZip, which is a tool used to compress archives, saving file space.
1.6) A tarbomb is an archive created with tar containing a large amount of files, which when extracted, has its contents "explode" into an existing 
	directory instead of creating a new one for its contents. This is dangerous since it can overwrite existing files and directories, causing a loss of data.
