1) I decided to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to copy to/from Mimi.
2) To install this program I ran Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode,
	I then ran the command 'wsl --install' and restarted my machine. Next, I
	reopened Command Prompt and ran 'wsl', which prompted me to create my linux
	username and password for this distribution, which finished the installation.
3) To copy a file from my computer to Mimi I would first need to open Command Prompt,
	run the command 'wsl' to run my installed Linux distribution, and then use rsync.
	Rsync lets us transfer/sync files between our computer and a server like Mimi and so,
	you can use 'rsync [option (-a)] [source file/directory(/mnt/c/Users/alice/Pictures/
	screenshot.png)] [destination (abakht@mimi.cs.mcgill.ca:~/fall2024-comp206/
	assignments/hw1/)]' to transfer any file over, such as the screenshot as put in the
	round brackets. After running it, I am prompted	to enter my Mimi password, which 
	I do, and then the transfer is completed.
